# LooperMachineProject
 Created with Angular
 
 Following the job interview on May 5th,  I have attached the task I was required to do. 
The project was written with Angular tools- TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. I would like to note that I was using Angular for the first time (including studying the programing language) and achieved all the goals except the synchronizing bit.
The final product can be seen on http://localhost:4200/ web address.
Thank you for the opportunity, and I'm hoping to hear from you,
Or Levran
